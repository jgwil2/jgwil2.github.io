================
This is hopefully going to soon be replaced by a cool blog, but for now I'm just getting the hang of GitHub, Jekyll, and Foundation, so I wanted to see what it would look like. 

UPDATE: The blog is more or less done although I haven't been able to post as often as I would like. But check out what I have so far, make suggestions, and keep coming back. Thanks!
