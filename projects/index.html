		<p>This is a recent project of mine that I decided to work on in order to improve my Javascript skills. It's a simple application that takes a user input text, looks for any Arabic numerals in it, and replaces them with their written English equivalents. This was a cool project because it allowed me to learn a lot of basic, native JS, which I was not as familiar with as PHP. Check out the working project, and if you're interested, read about it in <a href="/2014/03/05/javascript-text-parser/">this blog post</a> where I go into the details of the program.</p>
