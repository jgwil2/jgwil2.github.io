		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>My name is John Willard and I am a student currently residing in Strasbourg, France. Having spent the past few years teaching, both here in France and at home in the States, I'm now trying to transition into IT. For the most part I'm a newbie, so I've got a lot to learn! But one of the things that attracts me to this field is the fact that things are constantly evolving, and that you can never really stop learning. As part of that process, I'm creating this site, both to learn by doing and to share my new knowledge. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

		<p>Other that technology, I really like traveling and foreign languages. I came to France in order to improve my French skills, and I've been here now for the better part of the past two and a half years. One really cool thing about Europe (from an American perspective) is the diversity of cultures and languages all within a relatively small geographical space. Here in Strasbourg I can just hop on a city bus to go to Germany. It's definitely fun to explore all of the different areas that are relatively close by, but I also sometimes miss home. For my next project, I'd like to bring a Taco Bell franchise over here.</p>
