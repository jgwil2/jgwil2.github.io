Instructions for setting up virtual hosts
=========================================

For convenience, I have set up two sites in my `Projects/local` directory, 'workspace' and 'playground'. The default host is 'localhost' and its document root is located at `/var/www/html`.

To add virtual hosts:

1. Set up location of new site. Add `index.html` (or `index.php`) for testing.
2. Modify `/etc/hosts` file. Add loopback address for new website. (127.0.0.1 <tab> sitename)
3. Go to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` and add `sitename.conf` file (or just `sitename`). Add virtual host configuration inside:
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /path/to/site/root
	ServerName sitename
	ServerAlias sitealias
    </VirtualHost>
4. If site root is located anywhere other than `/var/www`, `/usr/share`, or a previously whitelisted directory, go to `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` and add root directory:
    <Directory /path/to/site/root>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
5. Run as root `a2ensite sitename` to enable site and `service apache2 reload` (or `/etc/init.d/apache2 reload`) to activate.

Go to [Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page](http://localhost) for more info.
